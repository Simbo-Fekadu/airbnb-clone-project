# Team Roles for Backend Systems, Database Design, API Development, and Application Security

This document outlines the key team roles involved in **backend systems**, **database design**, **API development**, and **application security**, based on insights from [ITRex Group Blog](https://itrexgroup.com/blog/#posts).

## 1. Backend Systems

- **Back-end Developer**  
  Responsible for implementing core server-side operations, handling application logic, data processing, and working with databases and APIs.

## 4. Application Security

- **Security Engineer**  
  Integrates security standards into all project stages, assesses vulnerabilities, and ensures protective mechanisms are built-in.  
  *[Source: ITRex Group Blog](https://itrexgroup.com/blog/discovery-phase-of-a-project-practical-guide/)*

- **Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer**  
  Tests for security and functional correctness, helps identify vulnerabilities through manual and automated testing.

## Database Design

### Key Entities

#### 1. Users
- **Fields:**
  - `id` (primary key)
  - `name`
  - `email`
  - `password`
  - `role` (guest or host)

#### 2. Properties
- **Fields:**
  - `id` (primary key)
  - `title`
  - `description`
  - `location`
  - `price_per_night`
  - `host_id` (foreign key â†’ Users)

#### 3. Bookings
- **Fields:**
  - `id` (primary key)
  - `user_id` (foreign key â†’ Users)
  - `property_id` (foreign key â†’ Properties)
  - `check_in_date`
  - `check_out_date`
  - `status` (pending, confirmed, canceled)

#### 4. Reviews
- **Fields:**
  - `id` (primary key)
  - `user_id` (foreign key â†’ Users)
  - `property_id` (foreign key â†’ Properties)
  - `rating`
  - `comment`

### Relationships

- A **User** can be a **Host** (list properties) or a **Guest** (book properties).  
- A **User** can have multiple **Properties** (if host).  
- A **Property** can have many **Bookings**.  
- A **Booking** belongs to one **User** (guest) and one **Property**.  
- A **Booking** has one **Payment**.  
- A **Property** can have many **Reviews**.  
- A **Review** is written by a **User** for a **Property**.
