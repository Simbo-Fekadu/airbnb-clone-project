## Database Design

### Key Entities

#### 1. Users
- **Fields:**
  - `id` (primary key)
  - `name`
  - `email`
  - `password`
  - `role` (guest or host)

#### 2. Properties
- **Fields:**
  - `id` (primary key)
  - `title`
  - `description`
  - `location`
  - `price_per_night`
  - `host_id` (foreign key â†’ Users)

#### 3. Bookings
- **Fields:**
  - `id` (primary key)
  - `user_id` (foreign key â†’ Users)
  - `property_id` (foreign key â†’ Properties)
  - `check_in_date`
  - `check_out_date`
  - `status` (pending, confirmed, canceled)

#### 4. Reviews
- **Fields:**
  - `id` (primary key)
  - `user_id` (foreign key â†’ Users)
  - `property_id` (foreign key â†’ Properties)
  - `rating`
  - `comment`

#### 5. Payments
- **Fields:**
  - `id` (primary key)
  - `booking_id` (foreign key â†’ Bookings)
  - `amount`
  - `payment_date`
  - `status` (paid, pending, failed)

---

### Relationships

- A **User** can be a **Host** (list properties) or a **Guest** (book properties).  
- A **User** can have multiple **Properties** (if host).  
- A **Property** can have many **Bookings**.  
- A **Booking** belongs to one **User** (guest) and one **Property**.  
- A **Booking** has one **Payment**.  
- A **Property** can have many **Reviews**.  
- A **Review** is written by a **User** for a **Property**.

## Feature Breakdown

### 1. User Management
Allows users to sign up, log in, and manage their profiles. Hosts can list properties, while guests can book stays, ensuring clear role separation and secure authentication.

### 2. Property Management
Hosts can create, update, and manage property listings with details such as title, description, location, and price. This feature ensures guests have access to accurate and up-to-date information.

### 3. Booking System
Guests can book properties for specific dates, with status tracking (pending, confirmed, canceled). This feature handles availability checks and prevents double bookings.

### 4. Payment Processing
Integrates payments for bookings, storing transaction details and payment status. Ensures a smooth and secure financial flow between guests and hosts.

### 5. Reviews & Ratings
Guests can leave reviews and ratings for properties theyâ€™ve stayed in. This feature builds trust in the platform and helps future guests make informed decisions.

### 6. Search & Filtering
Allows users to search properties by location, price, availability, and other criteria. This ensures a seamless user experience when finding the right stay.

## API Security

Securing the backend APIs is critical to ensure user trust, protect sensitive data, and maintain platform reliability. The following key measures will be implemented:

### 1. Authentication
All API endpoints will be protected using secure authentication mechanisms (e.g., JWT tokens). This ensures that only verified users can access the system and prevents unauthorized access.

### 2. Authorization
Role-based access control (RBAC) will be applied so that only hosts can manage properties, and only guests can make bookings. This prevents misuse of the system and enforces proper permissions across features.

### 3. Data Protection
Sensitive data such as passwords and payment details will be encrypted both at rest and in transit (using HTTPS and strong hashing algorithms like bcrypt). This prevents data leaks and protects user privacy.

### 4. Rate Limiting
APIs will include rate limiting to prevent abuse, such as denial-of-service (DoS) attacks or brute-force login attempts. This ensures platform stability and availability.

### 5. Input Validation & Sanitization
All API inputs will be validated and sanitized to prevent common vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, XSS, or command injection. This keeps the system safe from malicious requests.

### Why Security Matters for This Project
- **Protecting User Data:** Prevents unauthorized access to personal information like names, emails, and passwords.  
- **Securing Payments:** Ensures safe handling of transactions, reducing the risk of fraud or theft.  
- **Maintaining Trust:** Users are more likely to use the platform if they feel their information is safe.  
- **Ensuring Platform Reliability:** Security measures protect the system from abuse, downtime, and malicious attacks.  


## CI/CD Pipeline

### What is CI/CD?
Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment/Delivery (CD) pipelines automate the process of building, testing, and deploying the application. With CI/CD, every code change is automatically integrated, tested, and deployed, ensuring faster development cycles and higher-quality releases.

### Why Itâ€™s Important
- **Consistency:** Ensures that every code change goes through the same build and test process.  
- **Faster Delivery:** Automates deployments, reducing manual effort and speeding up feature releases.  
- **Reliability:** Detects bugs early through automated testing, preventing broken code from reaching production.  
- **Collaboration:** Helps teams work more efficiently by integrating changes continuously.  

### Tools We Can Use
- **GitHub Actions:** For automating workflows like testing and deployment directly from GitHub.  
- **Docker:** For containerizing the app, ensuring consistent environments across development, testing, and production.  
- **Jenkins / CircleCI:** As alternatives for advanced CI/CD automation.  
- **Netlify / Vercel / AWS / Heroku:** For deploying the application to production environments.
